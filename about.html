    <p style="background-color: #808080; font-size: 30px; color: white;";> We often hear the saying that water is the source of life so how can mankind waste this precious source that God has given us. A fine example is mentioned in this short film about saving water by depicting a boy who carelessly wastes a lots of water and then realozes his mistake. This goes to show that people only do things to benefit themselves not considering the needs of other people. Not only is water being wasted in developing countries but there is also water wastage  in developed countries. Water conservation is the key to saving our planet because soon it will become extinct to us human beings.</p>
